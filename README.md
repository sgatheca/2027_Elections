This Python script uses the pandas library to process election data from an [Excel file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20140978/Voters.2013_22.xlsx). It projects the number of registered voters for 2027 using the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) and projects the voter turnout for 2027 using a weighted average of historical turnout data. Finally, it saves the updated data, including the projections, to a new Excel file. 
To get the cleaned Excel file data, I have extracted elections data from IEBC website (2013, 2017 and 2022). The data was in .pdf format.
